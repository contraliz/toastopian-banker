# Currency bot
The most efficient and fun econ manager discord bot programmed using discord.py

  The way Toastopian Banker works is by two storage places, the bank and the wallet. The user will be able to spend money in the wallet, and send money from one user's bank account to the other. Users can spend money on items in the shop(including bank security) and can also sell the items. Selling the item will reduce the cost of the item by 80%. There is also a slots game, where the user bets their money to get more money or lose their bet. Users are also able to deposit money and withdraw money from their bank account. Users will also be able to either heist money from someone else's bank or rob from someone's wallet and robbing will not work if they don't have money in their wallet. But robbing and heisting will be punished and will be sent to jail. 
The new dunctions of the Toastopian banker is that you can SELL the possessions you don't want. Also, you don't just do your jobs for fun, you get paid! the currencybot features a new kind of currency: Coins! With them, you can buy as much beer as you want, or the huge mansion you always dreamed of.

  Balance is the total amount of money the users have. This comes in two forms: Wallet, and bank. The money in the wallet is for buying, selling, and giving money to people. In order to transfer the money from the bank to your wallet, simply do e!withdraw. But be careful! Wallets are easily robbed by people, so consider putting your lifetime saving into the bank which have the bank seurity system by doing e!deposit. The bank cannot be robbed, instead you need e!heist to break into the bank. To prevent people breaking into your bank, buy security points! The robber will fail every attempt and eventually fed up and leave!
