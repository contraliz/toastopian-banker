# Currency bot
The most efficient and fun econ manager discord bot programmed using discord.py

The way Toastopian Banker works is by two storage places, the bank and the wallet. The user will be able to spend money in the wallet, and send money from one user's bank account to the other. Users can spend money on items in the shop(including bank security) and can also sell the items. Selling the item will reduce the cost of the item by 80%. There is also a slots game, where the user bets their money to get more money or lose their bet. Users are also able to deposit money and withdraw money from their bank account. Users will also be able to either heist money from someone else's bank or rob from someone's wallet and robbing will not work if they don't have money in their wallet. But robbing and heisting will be punished and will be sent to jail.
